**AiNiee-Next** is an engineering-focused refactor of the [AiNiee](https://github.com/NEKOparapa/AiNiee) core logic, designed for command-line environments.

This project introduces **uv**, a modern Python package manager, and implements significant stability optimizations for the underlying runtime. By taking control of IO streams and exception handling, we have built a robust TUI environment perfect for long-running tasks, headless server deployments, and automated workflows.

## Built-in Smart Diagnostics and Issue Feedback Assistance

AiNiee-Next includes built-in error diagnostics and feedback assistance, so you can use it with confidence: if a task fails, you will not be left with only a cryptic traceback or logs with no clear next step. The system collects context such as the error stack, runtime environment, current platform and model, and recent operation flow, then uses rule-based diagnostics and optional LLM analysis to help determine whether the issue is more likely caused by the API, network, configuration, environment, or the project code itself.

If the diagnostics point to a suspected code issue, the program can also prepare a structured GitHub Issue with the error description, environment information, key traceback, initial analysis, and useful clues for debugging. You do not need to spend extra effort writing the report or interpreting complex errors yourself; the system helps turn the problem into a format that developers can understand, reproduce, and resolve more quickly.

- **Clearer next steps**: Helps distinguish configuration issues, environment issues, API issues, network issues, and suspected code defects
- **Easier feedback**: Automatically organizes Issue content with environment details, version information, traceback, and analysis results
- **Lower communication cost**: Reduces repeated follow-up questions between users and developers
- **Faster troubleshooting**: Turns problem reports into debugging material that is easier for developers to act on

## MCP Server

This project provides an optional MCP server module that reuses the existing WebServer backend and aims to cover the full Web API surface, so MCP clients can get an experience close to the Web dashboard.
Any LLM client that supports MCP over `stdio` or `streamable-http` can connect to this project directly, without reading repository files or manually assembling Web API calls.

**Startup Options:**
1. Direct CLI: `uv run ainiee_cli.py mcp --mcp-transport stdio`
2. Main menu: open the main menu and select **16. Start MCP Server**

**Notes:**
- The MCP server is optional and does not affect the main process when missing
- Required components and Python dependencies are checked on every MCP startup
- If dependencies are missing, the program shows complete install commands for the current system
- Menu startup uses background `streamable-http` mode and returns to the menu after 3 seconds
- If you change `mcp_server_port`, update the MCP route in your client as well

**Direct LLM client integration:**
1. MCP clients that support `stdio` can launch AiNiee CLI as a local MCP server.
If your client uses a `command + args` configuration format, this generic template can be used as a reference:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ainiee-cli": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "H:\\小说\\AiNiee-CLI",
        "--isolated",
        "--no-project",
        "--quiet",
        "--with",
        "mcp",
        "--with",
        "fastapi",
        "--with",
        "uvicorn[standard]",
        "--with",
        "requests",
        "python",
        "Tools/MCPServer/server.py",
        "--transport",
        "stdio"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Different clients may use slightly different field names, but the core idea is the same: `command=uv` plus the `args` shown above.
Replace the path with your own project directory. On Linux / macOS, replace `H:\\小说\\AiNiee-CLI` with `/path/to/AiNiee-CLI`.

2. If your client only accepts a raw command, use:

```bash
uv run --directory /path/to/AiNiee-CLI --isolated --no-project --quiet --with mcp --with fastapi --with uvicorn[standard] --with requests python Tools/MCPServer/server.py --transport stdio
```

3. Codex over `stdio`, preferably via the bundled launcher:

```bash
codex mcp add ainiee-cli -- /path/to/AiNiee-CLI/Tools/MCPServer/codex_stdio_launcher.sh
```

If this is the first startup and dependencies are not cached yet, add a larger timeout in `~/.codex/config.toml`, for example:

```toml
[mcp_servers.ainiee-cli]
startup_timeout_sec = 90
```

4. MCP clients that support `streamable-http` can connect directly to the MCP HTTP route exposed by AiNiee CLI.
Start it first with:

```bash
uv run ainiee_cli.py mcp --mcp-transport streamable-http
```

or from the main menu with **16. Start MCP Server**.

If the client uses a URL-style configuration, this is a valid reference:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ainiee-cli": {
      "transport": "streamable-http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Endpoints:

```text
Local endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp
LAN endpoint: http://<your-lan-ip>:8765/mcp
```

5. If MCP startup reports missing dependencies, run this from the project root:

```bash
set "UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=%CD%\.venv-win" && uv --directory "%CD%" add "mcp" "fastapi" "uvicorn[standard]" "requests"
```

On Linux / macOS, use:

```bash
UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT="$(pwd)/.venv" uv --directory "$(pwd)" add 'mcp' 'fastapi' 'uvicorn[standard]' 'requests'
```

If you change `mcp_server_port`, replace `8765` in the route above with the new port.
If the project `.venv` was created under another OS first, for example in WSL and then reused from Windows, recreate `.venv` before running `uv add` to avoid `lib64` / symlink related errors.

**Recommended first MCP calls for LLM clients:**
- `get_mcp_usage_manual`
- `get_mcp_security_policy`
- `get_mcp_tool_categories`
- `get_mcp_tool_catalog(category="<needed-category>")`
- `get_mcp_validation_checklist`

These tools tell the LLM what MCP capabilities are available, how tool parameters are structured, which routes are restricted, and why bypassing MCP is forbidden. The endpoint catalog is category-based by default, so clients do not need to inject every Web API endpoint into context at once.

**MCP security requirements:**
- The LLM must not bypass MCP by sending direct HTTP requests to the Web UI, localhost, or LAN ports
- The LLM must use MCP tools only for AiNiee operations
- `api_key` / `access_key` / `secret_key` are redacted on MCP reads
- MCP reads of sensitive config also return `_mcp_security_notice`, explicitly stating that the restriction is permission-based and that bypassing through any other channel is forbidden
- A redacted placeholder is not a usable secret and must not be written back as if it were real
- Sensitive Web API routes require a valid Web UI session cookie or MCP bridge token, so bare unauthenticated HTTP bypass requests are rejected

## Architecture

This project utilizes a Wrapper / Adapter pattern:

- **Core**: Original AiNiee core business logic unchanged
- **Adapter Layer**: `ainiee_cli.py` handles environment isolation and exception interception
- **Runtime**: Managed by uv for dependency consistency

---

## Manga Reference

The MangaCore subsystem uses a layered design: fully automatic batch translation and manual page refinement are treated as separate workflows instead of being merged into one entry point.

**The fully automatic manga translation workflow** primarily references the workflow represented by `manga-translator-ui-main` and its upstream project **hgmzhn / manga-translator-ui**:

- GitHub: https://github.com/hgmzhn/manga-translator-ui
- Gitee mirror: https://gitee.com/hgmzhn/manga-translator-ui

This part mainly references its staged workflow and runtime asset organization: image/archive import, text detection, OCR, translation, inpainting, text rendering, and final export. In AiNiee-Next, this low-interaction batch workflow is carried by `translate ... --manga`, the Web task page Manga Mode, and the `MangaCore` batch pipeline.

**Manual refinement and manga editor logic** primarily references **mayocream / Koharu**:

- GitHub: https://github.com/mayocream/koharu

This part mainly references Koharu's manual refinement ideas, including project/page/text-block models, layered page states, current-page reruns, text block position and style adjustments, inpaint result inspection, and editable final exports.

If related core modules are referenced, integrated, or reused in later stages, this project will continue to preserve source attribution and acknowledgement, and will comply with the corresponding open-source license terms.
